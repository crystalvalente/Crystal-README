Music has always had a very important role in my life. From singing in church as a kid and growing up playing 3 different instruments, to now being my pre-workout to the gym, and escape from reality. Music to me is like food and water... it's vital to my existence. Growing up in a Brasilian household, nothing is done without music. Cooking, cleaning, homework, no matter the time or the place, music is the filler of the silence. I connect a lot with music, and am able to indulge in many different styles and genres. They are relate to many different parts of my personality and experiences.
